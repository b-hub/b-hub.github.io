# Highlight

## [Faze Video Rendering](/projects/faze/2021/08/28/introducing-faze-video.html)

A new NuGet package has been added [Faze.Rendering.Video.FFMPEG](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Faze.Rendering.Video.FFMPEG/). 

This package extends the faze pipeline to add video rendering! The pipeline can now be split up and iterated over in order to produce video frames. The frames are piped to an externally installed ffmpeg command, so no filling up directories with hundreds of images - just straight to video!

The faze gallery also supports video, [so check them out!](https://b-faze.github.io/faze/)

# Blog Posts

## [Faze Gallery Improvements](/projects/faze/2021/08/27/faze-gallery-improvements.html)

The [faze gallery](https://b-faze.github.io/faze/) has been improved to give a better understanding of what the visualisation is representing. The change adds structure, tagging and a breakdown of the settings used to construct the image.

# Next Month

**September** who knows! I will be away during September, so there will be less development, but I will try and do some higher-level blog posts.
