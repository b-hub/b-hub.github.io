In a previous post “Learning a new skill”, I reflected on my learning process and concluded there are two important aspects - setting a concrete goal and making sure you stay motivated enough to achieve it. In order to satisfy both aspects, it helps to know the steps in order to achieve the goal. This will give you a good idea of the effort involved and to set expectations. Trying to distill acquiring a skill into a set of steps is not uncommon to those familiar with skill trees in games. In this post, I try to formalise the progression in snowboarding, visualising it as a skill tree.

# Skill trees

I will give a quick TLDR here, but there is already a great article, “Skill Tree Principle - An Innovative way to grow your skills efficiently”, which goes into detail explaining skill trees and applying them to real life skills.

A skill tree is used as a form of progression in games. It is a visual representation of every ability you could have and how to get it. Abilities are made to be desirable for the person playing the game, however they need to be unlocked in order to use. The most desirable abilities require unlocking other abilities as a prerequisite. Unlocking a skill requires a skill point, which the game rewards players with over time.

When applying a skill tree to real life “progression”, abilities are skills, like being able to do a backflip. To unlock the backflip skill you will first need the skills: jump, core strength, ariel awareness, (fearlessness), etc… The real life parallel to a skill point would be time spent practising.

### Goals
Shows what is possible
Clear path to acquiring a particular skill
Steps should be atomic. There shouldn’t be significant jumps between steps.
Highlights common prerequisite skills (hot skills)
Defines clear branches / specialisations
Current progression at a glance


## Minimum skill tree

At its most basic, learning to snowboard requires a person to first acquire a fundamental skill and then they are free to continue building on core skills (Advanced) or spec into three different environments. This initial tree does a good job emphasising the importance of learning the fundamentals and overall structure, but is a fairly uninspiring progression.

| Goal | Achieved? |

| Shows what is possible                                                      | No*  |
| Clear path to acquiring a particular skill                                  | No*  |
| Steps should be atomic. There shouldn’t be significant jumps between steps. | No   |
| Highlights common prerequisite skills (hot skills)                          | Yes  |
| Defines clear branches / specialisations                                    | Yes  |
| Current progression at a glance                                             | No   |

*Skill names are too vague.

### Better skill labelling

Labeling the steps can help make the tree more interesting. Even if you don’t understand the term “Linked turns”, the implication is you will once you complete the step.

When designing a skill tree for a game, a general principle is to make the initial steps simple to understand and increase the complexity as they get used to the mechanics. The key difference is completing a skill tree step in a game unlocks new mechanics / abilities, whereas in the real world completing a step happens after we have learnt the ability.

Linking your turns requires several hours of lessons, so as a first step it would be good to split it up to allow for a faster feedback loop. As snowboarding requires… well snow (and a slope), it might be helpful to include the location in the skill tree.

| Highlights common prerequisite skills (hot skills)                          | Yes  |
| Defines clear branches / specialisations                                    | Yes  |
| Current progression at a glance                                             | No   |

*The skill tree is too simple
