## Welcome

I am a Full-Stack Developer located in the UK, with 5+ years industry experience working full-time on public facing and internal web applications. If you would like to know more, take a look at the [About](/about/) page.

I am pationate about what I do, so much so that in my spare time I find myself testing new technologies and project ideas. This site is for keeping track of of all that work, documenting it as I go. It is as much for me, as it is for anyone with similar interests. Please take a look at my [Blog](/blog/) and make sure to up-to-date by subscribing to my newsletter on the [Follow](/follow/) page.
