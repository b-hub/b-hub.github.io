I am a Full-Stack Developer located in the UK with 5+ years industry experience, working full-time on public facing and internal web applications. I am pationate about what I do, so much so that in my spare time I find myself testing new technologies and project ideas. If you would like to know more, take a look at the [About page](/about/).

This site is intended for keeping track of any personal developement work and is as much for me, as it is for anyone interested in the things I get up to. Please take a look at my [Blog](/blog/) and make sure to up-to-date by subscribing to my newsletter on the [Follow](/follow/) page.
