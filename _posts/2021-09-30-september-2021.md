{% assign thisMonth = page.date | date: '%Y%m' %}

This is the third in a series of monthly newsletters summarising updates to projects, blog posts and any tech news that has caught my interest. I have been away most of this month, so no new development but there are a couple of high-level articles I have managed to squeeze in.

# Highlight

{% for post in site.posts %}
    {% assign month = post.date | date: '%Y%m' %}
    {% if month == thisMonth and post.monthly_highlight and post.type != "monthly" %}

{% if post.highlight_banner_url %}
![highlight banner]({{post.highlight_banner_url}})
{% endif %}

## [{{post.title}}]({{post.url}})

{{post.excerpt}}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
